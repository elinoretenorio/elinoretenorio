## Hi, I'm Elinore. 

### You don't know me. But hopefully after reading this, you'd have some idea about how I work.

> Elinore was able to adapt quickly to the NOC admin role and was able to fulfill tasks quickly and without major errors. She knows when she to escalate or seek help from more experienced admins and keeps her manager and affected team members informed of any urgent issue in progress. She was able to help fulfill our admin support needs, usually fulfilled by 2 full-time employees - even during our busiest hours.

**- NOC Manager**

> Elinore continues to be a subject-matter expert especially when there are client issues as she prepares to roll off her team. She remained to be focused and delivers value to her internal and external customers.

**- NOC Director**

> Elinore worked diligently on her assigned project to get it up and running. She worked with the product developer, counterparts and vendor resources to address issues. Elinore - thanks for your persistence! We're almost there!

**- Product Development Manager**

> Elinore's quick trouble shooting and research of the issues after the system go-live, have resulted in many _wins_ and fixes to help stabilize the system.

**- Manager**

> I wanted to tell you, in case you had not already been told. Everyone here was very impressed with how you handled the outage on your side. Our VP for Internal Services personally stopped by and commented how great your notes and status emails were. Great job. This type of issue does not occur often, we hope, and we have some basic steps to take when they do. But we had nothing in place to coordinate such a large outage. You did a great job taking ownership on your side and keeping everyone informed. Your compiled troubleshooting document is being passed around like crazy. I, myself, have gotten it from at least two different sources. It is a great benchmark to start at and gives us a solid platform, once confirmed and configured, to start from for the issues that go beyond the basics. I sleep well, even during this issue, knowing that you are so competent and flexible to use all your resources available to find solutions for the clients.

**- Senior Admin**

> I provided direction for Elinore's work while she worked on the BMC Team. During this period Elinore further established herself as a BMC Admin and Development expert providing service to internal and external customers. Elinore quickly responded to incidents assigned to the team and managed the queue effectively. She was able to assess the priority of the issues and focus on the more critical tasks. Elinore also handled system outage situations professionally; she worked to restore service as quickly as possible and communicated the problem and resolution to the rest of her team in a thorough and helpful manner.

> Elinore demonstrated strong stewardship in her role and often looked for ways to improve productivity for herself and the team.

> As Elinore prepared to roll-off, she documented several key tasks, responsibilities, and processes to help her replacements learn the job and come up to speed on the tool. She also held weekly training and shadowing sessions to transfer her admin knowledge to the team in Manila. Elinore's expertise and dedication to the team will be missed.

**- Manager**

> I think the plugins Elinore have developed are by far the best I have seen from other developers. Her instructions are easy to follow and she always help with support.

**- Steve, Speedy Job**

> Had the pleasure of working with Elinore on numerous customisations for our system. Service was superb with quick turnarounds and intelligent technical solutions to our requirements. Highly recommended.

**- Warren, SAProfessionals**

> Good and reliable code, great communication and overall skills. Codes easily adapted for new versions.

**- Neven, Free Job Listings CA**

> Yesterday I decided to take the plunge to upgrade my installation for my job board on Recruitment Views, although it was not quite working correctly I decided to include the add-ons Elinore have developed. Any upgrade always fills me with terror, and as more often than not, they can go wrong, but when it does you want help ASAP. I can honestly say the upgrade was relatively easy and more important the tweaks need for my site were sorted in minutes. I did not hesitate giving Elinore a reference, because what made her stand out was, apart from her speedy response she went the extra mile to ensure it worked for me.

**- Stephen, Recruitment Views**

> Many thanks to Elinore for the great backfill plugin. This has worked great and worked straight away with no problems. It is really useful for starting an empty job board with real jobs that are useful to users straight off.

**- Andy, Casino Jobs**

> I couldn't be happier. Elinore is an excellent coder and developer, super responsive, an excellent communicator, quick and creative, and completely reliable -- in short, a great partner. Would recommend to others anytime!

**- Josh, Doc Opps/Jobs In The Valley**

> You can depend on her. Extremely trustworthy. She's been with me in development for more than 6 years. She is passionate, a driver for innovation. Very creative spirit. Much like you kill her total productivity when you put her in a box. Allow her free rein in her domain whether it's a project, a team. She is a team player/leader.

**- Dave, CTO**

> Elinore, Thank you so much for being on top of the release! You're making my work a lot easier ðŸ™‚

**- Project Manager**

> Kudos to Elinore for completing all the migrations over the last month without a single hitch.

**- CTO**

> TBH â€” Elinore is really good about quashing small bugs...itâ€™s hard to think of something she hasnâ€™t already found and addressed, from tickets getting escalated or her just browsing the unclaimed view for XX tickets.

**- Support Manager**

> Another straightforward release. Thank goodness we have Elinore. Sheâ€™s the best. Also, no hotfixes. 

**- Project Manager**

> Elinore is the best.

**- Support Team Lead**

> Itâ€™s Elinore thatâ€™s on top of things :sweat_smile:

**- Project Manager**

> Elinore! Thank you so much for seeing that and alerting ... so it could be fixed. Thank you both for taking good care of our customers, and extra thanks to you, Elinore, for taking the time to reply to them! I sincerely appreciate itâ€¦so much! And I know they do, too. :relaxed:

**- VP, Customer Experience**

> Those internal notes you leave are heroic/a major relief for confusing situations...
